# Getting Started with React Native using Expo

This repository will guide you through setting up a React Native app with Expo, a framework that simplifies the development of Android, iOS, and web applications.

## System Requirements

- **Node.js (LTS):** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **Operating System:** macOS, Windows (PowerShell and WSL 2), or Linux. This guide uses Windows.

## Setting Up the Project

### Step 1: Create a New Expo Project

I recommend starting with the default project created by `create-expo-app`. This default project includes example code to help you get started.

To create a new project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest

### Step 2: Setting Up Your Development Environment

Now that you have a project, it's time to set up your development environment.

#### Install JDK

**Prerequisites**

Use a package manager such as Chocolatey to install the necessary dependencies.

**Install Dependencies**

Install the Java SE Development Kit (JDK):

```bash
choco install -y microsoft-openjdk17
